The GUI Road Trip Project is a graphical application designed to visualize road trip data based on trip logs that include latitude and longitude. The project allows users to input or upload trip information and provides a visual display of the trip path, along with the corresponding time data, offering an intuitive interface for monitoring and analyzing trips.

Project Goals
The main objective of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that can accurately interpret and display trip data. The application helps users visualize the geographic journey of a car by plotting the latitude and longitude of its route on a map. ensuring the data is both informative and accessible.

Key Features
Intuitive Interface: A clean, interactive GUI that allows users to easily input trip logs or upload trip data files.
Real-Time Visualization: The application plots the driving path on a map, showing the exact route based on latitude and longitude points.
Trip Time Calculation: Automatically computes the total trip time from the provided data and displays it within the application.
Data Management: Supports loading trip data in a structured format and handles both manual input and bulk data processing.
Customizable Display: Users can adjust the map view and display options to focus on specific segments of the trip.
Technical Details
Programming Language: Built using [SFML/other framework] for the GUI and graphics rendering.
Data Input: Supports latitude/longitude entry through manual input or by loading CSV/JSON data files.
Mapping Library: Incorporates mapping tools to visualize the trip's geographic path on a detailed map.
Time Calculations: Automatically processes timestamps from trip logs and provides the total trip duration.
User Interaction: Features clickable map points, zoom controls, and interactive time displays for detailed trip analysis.
