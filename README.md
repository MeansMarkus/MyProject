The GUI Flight Project is a graphical application designed to visualize and manage flight data based on trip logs that include latitude, longitude, and flight times. The project allows users to input or upload flight information and provides a visual display of the flight path, along with the corresponding time data, offering an intuitive interface for monitoring and analyzing flights.

Project Goals
The main objective of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that can accurately interpret and display flight data. The application helps users visualize the geographic journey of a plane by plotting the latitude and longitude of its route on a map. Additionally, it calculates and presents the total flight time, ensuring the data is both informative and accessible.

Key Features
Intuitive Interface: A clean, interactive GUI that allows users to easily input trip logs or upload flight data files.
Real-Time Visualization: The application plots the flight path on a map, showing the exact route based on latitude and longitude points.
Flight Time Calculation: Automatically computes the total flight time from the provided data and displays it within the application.
Data Management: Supports loading flight data in a structured format and handles both manual input and bulk data processing.
Customizable Display: Users can adjust the map view and display options to focus on specific segments of the flight.
Technical Details
Programming Language: Built using [SFML/other framework] for the GUI and graphics rendering.
Data Input: Supports latitude/longitude entry through manual input or by loading CSV/JSON data files.
Mapping Library: Incorporates mapping tools to visualize the flight's geographic path on a detailed map.
Time Calculations: Automatically processes timestamps from trip logs and provides the total flight duration.
User Interaction: Features clickable map points, zoom controls, and interactive time displays for detailed trip analysis.
